Vive Wireless Auto Start

The Vive Wireless adapter is great!  I love useing it.  However it adds yet ANOTHER program I need to remember to open and close when I start up SteamVR.  I couldn't find a way to automatically have the Vive Wireless application start when SteamVR started so I constantly had to worry about it.  But no more!  Just run this in the background and it will take care of all of that for you.  VWAS will start the Vive Wireless app when you start SteamVR and close it when you stop SteamVR.  Just add it to your startup programs and you'll never have to think about it again.  

Place VWAS.exe or VWAS.py into it's own folder, and run it with Python 3.  It will open up a console window and you shouldn't need to do anything else unless there is a problem.  I'd recommend also adding a shortcut to it in your startup programs.  It should take up virtually 0 CPU resources for any CPU capable of using the wireless adapter itself.

For now this will show a command line window constantly.  I'm not sure how to get around that right now.  Because ever aftermaking it a pyw file, because of what I use to listen for SteamVR it still shows up a command window.  If anyone knows a way around that, while still letting it show up if there is an error at startup, please do let me know!
