Place VWAS.py into it's own folder, and run it with Python 3.  It will open up a console window and you should't need to do anything else unless there is a problem.

I do not know how to hide the window so for now you'll have to leave it open constantly.  If someone knows how to make the window close if there is no errors to repot please let me know!
